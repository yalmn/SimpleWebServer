Welcome to the Simple Web Server in C project! 
This repository contains a basic implementation of a web server designed for Linux, utilizing the '<arpa/inet.h>' library. 
The purpose of this project is to provide a straightforward and educational example of how a web server can be constructed in C.

## Features

    - Basic HTTP request handling
    - Simple response generation
    - Lightweight and easy to understand code
